# Resume Tailoring Prompt Cookbook

I’ve always believed a good résumé is less about buzzwords and more about clarity. Students often have the skills, but struggle to show them in a way recruiters actually notice.  

The Resume Tailoring Prompt Cookbook is a free resource built to make that process easier. It’s a set of prompts, examples, and patterns that help students write résumés that are specific, authentic, and job-ready — no fluff, no fabrication.  

This project is part of LEO Education Resources, our open initiative to give students free tools like guides, textbooks, and workshops. Nothing here is paywalled. It’s for anyone preparing for internships and new-grad roles, especially in software engineering.  

If you’d like to suggest improvements, add examples, or adapt this for your own student group, feel free to fork and contribute.
