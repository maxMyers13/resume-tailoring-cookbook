# 1.1 - General SWE

### What to emphasize

* Core CS fundamentals, clean code, testing, version control
* Shipping features end to end in class or club projects
* Practical debugging, documentation, and team habits

### Copy-paste prompts

#### Role Switcher

```markdown
SWITCH ROLE → General SWE
Priority: breadth, reliability, basic DevOps, testing, and end-to-end delivery. Use general SWE keywords from the JD. Keep explanations clear for a non-technical recruiter.
```

#### Core tailor prompt

```
Use the JD and this experience to produce 2–3 General SWE bullets.
Rules:
- Add one short context clause so a non-technical recruiter understands the project.
- Include one measurable outcome per bullet.
- Echo the JD’s core skills naturally.
- Evidence only. No fabrication.

JD:
[Paste]

Experience:
[Paste role or project]

Return the bullets, then a TODO list for any missing metrics.
```

#### Role micro-prompts

```
Add one test or tooling keyword from the JD without keyword stuffing.
```

```
Add one brief line that proves teamwork: standups, code reviews, sprint goals, or ticketing.
```

### Fix weak bullets for this role

Ask up to 5 questions to reveal: feature shipped, user impact, testing method, code review habits, and collaboration details (standups, PRs, ticketing). Then write 2–3 bullets.

### Examples

#### Short patterns you can model

* Built XR lesson modules in Unity for a classroom learning platform, resolved input latency bugs, and improved average frame rate to 30.1 FPS; piloted with students and captured satisfaction ratings.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x54;ODO: add sample size and survey n._
* Closed student device tickets with a standard triage flow and Windows imaging tools, documented fixes for the top recurring issues, and reduced repeat tickets over the term.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x54;ODO: add ticket counts per week and reduction percent._

#### Before → After (one transform)

**Before**\
Worked on Unity lessons for VR education platform.

**After**\
Integrated STEM lessons into a Unity XR classroom module for middle-school learners, fixed input latency issues, and improved average frame rate from 27 to 30.1 FPS, contributing to higher student satisfaction on pilot surveys.\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;ODO: add sample size of pilot and survey n._

**Before**\
Helped on IT support.

**After**\
Resolved student device tickets using a standard triage checklist and imaging tools, documented fixes for recurring issues, and lowered repeat tickets for the top 3 problems.\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;ODO: attach counts per week or month._

### Quick checklist

* One metric per bullet
* Mention testing or tooling where relevant
* Show one teamwork habit (standups, reviews, or ticketing)
* One line, verb first, correct tense
